string.gsub({s}, {pattern}, {repl} [, {n}])                    *string.gsub()*
    Returns a copy of {s} in which all (or the first {n}, if given)
    occurrences of the {pattern} have been replaced by a replacement string
    specified by {repl}, which can be a string, a table, or a function. `gsub`
    also returns, as its second value, the total number of matches that
    occurred.

    If {repl} is a string, then its value is used for replacement. The
    character `%` works as an escape character: any sequence in {repl} of the
    form `%n`, with `n` between 1 and 9, stands for the value of the {n}-th
    captured substring (see below). The sequence `%0` stands for the whole
    match. The sequence `%%` stands for a single `%`.

    If {repl} is a table, then the table is queried for every match, using the
    first capture as the key; if the pattern specifies no captures, then the
    whole match is used as the key.

    If {repl} is a function, then this function is called every time a match
    occurs, with all captured substrings passed as arguments, in order; if the
    pattern specifies no captures, then the whole match is passed as a sole
    argument.

    If the value returned by the table query or by the function call is
    a string or a number, then it is used as the replacement string;
    otherwise, if it is `false` or `nil`, then there is no replacement (that
    is, the original match is kept in the string).

    Here are some examples:
>
         x = string.gsub("hello world", "(%w+)", "%1 %1")
         --> x="hello hello world world"

         x = string.gsub("hello world", "%w+", "%0 %0", 1)
         --> x="hello hello world"

         x = string.gsub("hello world from Lua", "(%w+)%s*(%w+)", "%2 %1")
         --> x="world hello Lua from"

         x = string.gsub("home = $HOME, user = $USER", "%$(%w+)", os.getenv)
         --> x="home = `home`roberto, user = roberto"

         x = string.gsub("4+5 = $return 4+5$", "%$(.-)%$", function (s)
           return loadstring(s)()
         end)
         --> x="4+5 = 9"

         local t = {name="lua", version="5.1"}
         x = string.gsub("$name-$version.tar.gz", "%$(%w+)", t)
         --> x="lua-5.1.tar.gz"
